            <li><b> PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT OF PHOTO VOLTAIC FED SERIES ACTIVE POWER FILTERS FOR DISTRIBUTED
                    GENERATION</b></li>
            <p>
                This paper deals with the performance of Series Active Power Filter (SAPF) for the power quality
                improvement
                based on the distributed generation. The SAPF has the ability to mitigate the voltage related problems
                in
                the distribution system. The real power supply is given by the PV system (Distributed Generation) for
                the
                compensation of the voltage related problems. The control strategy is achieved through the Synchronous
                Reference Frame Theory for the generation of the reference voltage which is compared with constant
                voltage
                for pulse generation using hysteresis band PWM. The SAPF has the better performance in the elimination
                of
                the voltage related problems in the distribution side. The performance of SAPF is modeled and simulated
                using MATLAB / SIMULINK

            <li><b>TRAIN ACCIDENT PREVENTION SYSTEM </b></li>
            <p>The increasing reliance on rail transportation demands a robust and comprehensive Train Accident
                Prevention System (TAPS) to ensure the safety of passengers, crew, and the public. This paper outlines a
                holistic approach to TAPS, integrating advanced technologies and safety measures to mitigate potential
                risks. Key components include Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems employing sensors and communication
                networks for real-time monitoring and control. Positive Train Control (PTC) ensures collision avoidance
                and overspeed derailment prevention through GPS, wireless communication, and onboard control systems.
                Advanced signaling, infrastructure monitoring, and improved railroad crossing safety enhance overall
                safety. Human factors, cybersecurity, and continuous data analysis contribute to the efficacy of the
                system. Collaboration among stakeholders and a commitment to ongoing maintenance and improvement are
                essential for the successful implementation of TAPS in the dynamic landscape of rail transportation.

            <li><b>ELECTRIC BICYCLE</b></li>
            <p>The Electric Bicycle Project aims to design, develop, and implement an innovative electric bicycle
                (e-bike) that combines sustainable transportation with cutting-edge technology. The project focuses on
                enhancing the traditional bicycle experience by integrating an electric propulsion system while
                addressing key aspects such as efficiency, usability, and environmental impact. The e-bike features a
                lightweight frame, regenerative braking, and a lithium-ion battery pack for extended range and
                performance.The propulsion system includes a brushless DC motor and a user-friendly control interface, allowing
                riders to seamlessly switch between electric and manual modes. An intelligent power management system
                optimizes energy consumption and extends battery life. The e-bike is designed to comply with regulatory
                standards, promoting safety and accessibility for riders of various skill levels.</p>
